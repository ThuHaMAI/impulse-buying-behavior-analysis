This study aims at analyzing the factors affecting the urge of impulse buying behavior witnessed in young Hanoian consumers in social commerce. These factors are mostly related to social interactions - the outstanding features facilitated by social commerce platforms. The data for this study were randomly collected from the young population of Hanoi via a survey from February to April 2021, of which results indicating that Parasocial interactions (PAR), Social interactions (INT), and Hedonic consumption (HED) positively affect the urge to buy impulsively (URG). The study not only proposes appropriate tactics for businesses to boost sales but also gives advice to young consumers on how to shop appropriately.

This project is the second part of an end-to-end research I did as the first author during undergrad senior year. The link to the published paper (which is the first part of this research, but unfortunately, in Vietnamese) can be found in the intro. This repository includes:
- a dataset cleaned from +300 respondents
- a R codes file
- the report improved from the original paper for the "Data Analysis" class during my Master 1 BDEEM (which I miss so much!)
- a list of references
